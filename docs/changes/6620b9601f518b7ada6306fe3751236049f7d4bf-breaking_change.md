# Change Documentation: Critical Removal of Django Settings
## Overview
This commit introduces a severe breaking change by removing critical Django configurations necessary for the application to function. The removal of essential settings from `CollegeERP/settings.py`, including database, template engine, WSGI application pointer, static files, internationalization, authentication validators, and REST framework configurations, renders the application non-functional. Despite re-enabling URL and WSGI modules, the missing settings make the entire application inoperable. This change requires immediate remediation.

## Impact
The impact of this change is far-reaching, affecting multiple components of the system:
* **Application Startup**: The application will fail to start due to the absence of critical settings.
* **Database Access**: The removal of database settings (`DATABASES`) prevents the application from accessing the database.
* **Web Serving**: The application will not be able to serve web pages due to the lack of template engine settings (`TEMPLATES`) and WSGI application pointer (`WSGI_APPLICATION`).
* **API Functionality**: The removal of REST framework configurations (`REST_FRAMEWORK`) breaks API functionality.
* **Static Files Serving**: The absence of static files settings (`STATIC_URL`) prevents the application from serving static files.
* **Authentication System**: The removal of authentication validators (`AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`) and other authentication-related settings breaks the authentication system.
* **Template Rendering**: The lack of template engine settings (`TEMPLATES`) prevents the application from rendering templates.

## New Features
There are no new features introduced in this commit.

## Breaking Changes
This commit introduces a severe breaking change by removing critical Django configurations. The following settings were removed:
* `TEMPLATES`
* `WSGI_APPLICATION`
* `DATABASES`
* `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`
* `LANGUAGE_CODE`
* `TIME_ZONE`
* `USE_I18N`
* `USE_L10N`
* `USE_TZ`
* `STATIC_URL`
* `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`
* `REST_FRAMEWORK`

To migrate to this change, you will need to restore the removed settings or reconfigure the application to use alternative settings. However, it is recommended to revert this change and restore the original settings to ensure the application remains functional.

## Technical Details
The `CollegeERP/settings.py` file experienced a major deletion, removing critical configurations necessary for a Django application to operate. Concurrently, `CollegeERP/urls.py` and `CollegeERP/wsgi.py`, which were previously commented out, have been uncommented, reactivating the project's URL dispatching and the WSGI application interface respectively. The `test.txt` file has been removed.

## Usage Examples
There are no usage examples for this change, as the application is currently non-functional.

## Testing
To test the changes, you can attempt to start the application and verify that it fails to start due to the absence of critical settings. You can also test individual components, such as database access, web serving, and API functionality, to verify that they are broken.

## Migration Guide
To migrate to a functional state, follow these steps:
1. Revert the changes to `CollegeERP/settings.py` to restore the original settings.
2. Verify that the application starts and functions correctly.
3. If necessary, reconfigure the application to use alternative settings or configurations.
4. Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all components are functioning correctly.

Note: It is recommended to revert this change and restore the original settings to ensure the application remains functional. This change should not be merged into a production branch without proper remediation.
