# Workflow v1.1

## Development Workflow
### Setup Process
1. **Environment setup and configuration**: Set up a development environment with the necessary tools and software, including a code editor, version control system (e.g., Git), and a package manager (e.g., pip).
2. **Dependency installation**: Install the required dependencies for the project, including libraries, frameworks, and other tools.
3. **Development environment preparation**: Prepare the development environment by creating a new branch, setting up a virtual environment, and installing any additional dependencies required for development.

```
[Start] → [Create Branch] → [Code] → [Test] → [PR] → [Review] → [Merge]
                                         ↓                ↓
                                      [Failed]        [Changes]
                                         ↓                ↓
                                      [Fix] ←----------[Fix]
```
The development process involves the following steps:
* Create a new branch for the feature or bug fix.
* Write code for the feature or bug fix.
* Test the code to ensure it works as expected.
* Create a pull request (PR) to merge the code into the main branch.
* Review the code to ensure it meets the project's standards and guidelines.
* Merge the code into the main branch if it passes review.

### Code Review Process
* **Review guidelines and standards**: Review the code to ensure it meets the project's guidelines and standards, including coding style, naming conventions, and best practices.
* **Approval requirements and process**: Ensure that the code has been approved by at least one other developer before merging it into the main branch.
* **Quality gates and checks**: Perform quality checks, such as testing and code analysis, to ensure the code is of high quality and meets the project's requirements.

## Deployment Workflow
### Development Deployment
* **Steps for development environment**: Deploy the code to a development environment, such as a staging server, to test and validate the changes.
* **Testing and validation**: Test and validate the changes in the development environment to ensure they work as expected.
* **Rollback procedures**: Establish rollback procedures in case the changes cause issues in the development environment.

### Production Deployment
* **Production deployment steps**: Deploy the code to a production environment, such as a live server, using a deployment script or tool.
* **Monitoring and validation**: Monitor the production environment to ensure the changes are working as expected and validate the deployment.
* **Emergency rollback process**: Establish an emergency rollback process in case the changes cause issues in the production environment.

## CI/CD Pipeline
* **Build process and automation**: Automate the build process using a tool, such as Jenkins or Travis CI, to ensure consistency and reliability.
* **Testing stages and quality gates**: Implement testing stages and quality gates to ensure the code is of high quality and meets the project's requirements.
* **Deployment automation**: Automate the deployment process using a tool, such as Ansible or Kubernetes, to ensure consistency and reliability.

## Release Process
* **Version management and tagging**: Manage versions and tag releases to ensure consistency and reliability.
* **Release notes and communication**: Create release notes and communicate changes to stakeholders, including developers, testers, and end-users.
* **Documentation updates**: Update documentation to reflect changes and ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.

## Monitoring & Maintenance
* **Health checks and monitoring**: Perform regular health checks and monitoring to ensure the system is working as expected.
* **Logging and alerting**: Implement logging and alerting to detect and respond to issues quickly.
* **Incident response procedures**: Establish incident response procedures to respond to issues and minimize downtime.

## Recent Changes Impact
The recent changes, specifically the removal of essential settings and configurations, will have a significant impact on the development workflow. The changes will break the project's functionality, including database connections, user authentication, and template rendering. As a result, the development process will need to be adjusted to accommodate these changes. The following adjustments will be made:
* **Update the setup process**: Update the setup process to reflect the changes and ensure that the development environment is properly configured.
* **Modify the development process**: Modify the development process to account for the changes and ensure that the code is properly tested and validated.
* **Update the deployment workflow**: Update the deployment workflow to reflect the changes and ensure that the code is properly deployed to the production environment.
* **Adjust the CI/CD pipeline**: Adjust the CI/CD pipeline to account for the changes and ensure that the code is properly built, tested, and deployed.
* **Update the release process**: Update the release process to reflect the changes and ensure that the release notes and documentation are accurate and up-to-date.
* **Modify the monitoring and maintenance process**: Modify the monitoring and maintenance process to account for the changes and ensure that the system is properly monitored and maintained.

To address the recent changes, the following documentation updates will be made:
* **Update the README**: Update the README to reflect the changes and ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.
* **Create a changelog**: Create a changelog to document the changes and provide a record of the project's history.
* **Update the API documentation**: Update the API documentation to reflect the changes and ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.
* **Create a migration guide**: Create a migration guide to help developers migrate to the new version of the project and ensure a smooth transition.
