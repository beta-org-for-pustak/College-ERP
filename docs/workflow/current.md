Based on the provided `README` and file structure, here is the workflow/process documentation for the `College-ERP` repository.

Please note that the provided `README` focuses primarily on local setup and usage. Consequently, several advanced processes like production deployment, comprehensive testing, CI/CD, and formal release procedures are not explicitly detailed.

# College-ERP Workflow and Process Documentation

This document outlines the known and inferred workflows for the College-ERP system, a Django-based college management application.

## 1. Development Workflow

The development workflow primarily involves setting up a local environment, making code changes, and testing them using Django's built-in development server and admin interface.

### 1.1. Environment Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2.  **Install Django:**
    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```
    *(Note: For a robust development environment, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.)*
3.  **Clone Repository:** Obtain the project source code. (Assumed from "Go to the College-ERP folder").

### 1.2. Local Development and Testing

1.  **Navigate to Project Directory:** Change your current directory to the `College-ERP` project folder (where `manage.py` is located).
2.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    This command starts the local development server, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
3.  **Database Migrations (Inferred):** As a Django project, developers are expected to manage database schema changes using migrations.
    *   Generate migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations [app_name]`
    *   Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
4.  **Admin User Setup:**
    *   Access the Django admin page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.
    *   **Create a Superuser (if none exists):**
        ```bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
        Follow the prompts to create an administrator account.
    *   **Login to Admin:** Use the created superuser credentials (default for existing 'admin' is 'admin' / 'project123').

### 1.3. User Management and Data Setup (via Admin)

The Django admin page (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`) is the primary interface for initial data setup and ongoing management:

1.  **Create Students/Teachers:** New user accounts for students and teachers can be added. Each requires a separate user entry.
    *   **Login Credentials:** For regular users (students/teachers), the username is their name (e.g., 'samarth', 'trisila') and the password for everyone is 'project123'.
2.  **Modify Core Data:** The admin page allows modification of various system tables:
    *   Students
    *   Teachers
    *   Departments
    *   Courses
    *   Classes
    *   **Attendance Range:** The "Update (29/11/2020)" feature highlights that the `Attendance` section within the Admin page (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/info/attendanceclass/`) is used to reset the attendance period by setting "Start Date" and "End Date".

### 1.4. User Interaction (Student/Teacher)

1.  **Access Application:** Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a web browser.
2.  **Login:** Use the provided generic credentials:
    *   **Username:** User's name (e.g., 'samarth' for student, 'trisila' for teacher).
    *   **Password:** 'project123' (common for all).
3.  **Interact with Features:** Students and teachers can interact with features like attendance, marks, and timetables.

### 1.5. Documentation Reference

For detailed understanding of system features and internal workings, refer to the "reports included" with the repository.

## 2. Build and Deployment Process

Based on the provided `README`, a formal build and production deployment process is **not explicitly documented.** The instructions focus solely on running the application locally using Django's development server.

### 2.1. Build Process (Inferred for Production)

For a production environment, a typical Django "build" process would involve:

1.  **Dependency Installation:** Installing all project dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2.  **Static Files Collection:** Collecting all static assets (CSS, JS, images) into a single directory for serving by a web server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```
3.  **Database Migrations:** Ensuring all database migrations are applied to the production database.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### 2.2. Deployment Process (Not Documented)

The `README` does not provide instructions for deploying the application to a production environment. A production deployment for a Django application typically involves:

*   Using a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI).
*   Configuring a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to serve static files and proxy requests to the WSGI server.
*   Setting up a robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   Managing environment variables for sensitive settings.
*   Containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistency across environments.
*   Cloud provider specific deployment strategies (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

## 3. Testing Procedures

The `README` does **not explicitly define** any testing procedures beyond the implied manual verification of features by running the local server and logging in.

### 3.1. Automated Testing (Implied Capability)

*   The presence of `apis/tests.py` indicates that the project has the structure to include automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) using Django's built-in testing framework.
*   **Missing:** There are no instructions on how to run these tests, what test coverage is expected, or if tests are mandatory before committing code.

### 3.2. Manual Testing (Implicit)

*   Developers are expected to manually verify changes by running `python manage.py runserver`, logging in as various user types (student, teacher, admin), and interacting with the system's features (attendance, marks, timetable, admin modifications, attendance range reset).

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is **not documented** in the provided `README`. There is no mention of automated processes for building, testing, or deploying code changes.

### 4.1. Current State

*   **No Automated Integration:** Code changes are likely integrated manually without automated checks.
*   **No Automated Deployment:** Deployments appear to be manual, given the lack of production deployment instructions.

### 4.2. Recommended (Future Enhancement)

A robust CI/CD pipeline would typically include:

*   **Continuous Integration:**
    *   Automated execution of tests (unit, integration) upon every code commit.
    *   Static code analysis and linting.
    *   Building docker images (if containerized).
*   **Continuous Deployment/Delivery:**
    *   Automated deployment to staging environments upon successful CI.
    *   Manual or automated promotion to production environments after further testing.

## 5. Release Process

A formal release process, including versioning, changelogs, and release cadence, is **not explicitly documented.**

### 5.1. Update Communication (Informal)

The "Update (29/11/2020)" section suggests an informal communication method for significant changes or new features. This indicates that updates are made and highlighted, but not necessarily part of a structured release cycle.

### 5.2. Current State

*   **No Formal Versioning:** There's no indication of semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0) or tagging releases.
*   **No Release Notes:** While updates are mentioned, formal release notes detailing all changes, bug fixes, and new features are not described as part of a process.
*   **No Defined Release Cadence:** Releases appear to be event-driven (when a feature is ready) rather than on a fixed schedule.
