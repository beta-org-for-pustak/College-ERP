## Current Architecture
The system consists of a Django application with a frontend built using py and js. The application uses a database, which can be one of PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or Redis. The system has a complex directory structure, with multiple subdirectories, including ./apis, ./CollegeERP, and others. The application relies on several dependencies, including asgiref, Django, djangorestframework, djoser, pytz, and sqlparse.

## Data Flow
The data flow in the system is not explicitly defined, as the analysis does not provide information on how data is processed or transmitted between components. However, it can be inferred that the frontend sends requests to the Django application, which then interacts with the database to retrieve or store data.

## Recent Changes Impact
The recent changes have introduced a breaking change, removing essential Django settings from the CollegeERP/settings.py file. This change has rendered the application non-functional, as it is no longer able to connect to the database, serve static files, or authenticate users. The removal of these settings has affected multiple components, including the database, frontend, and authentication system. To restore functionality, the essential settings must be reinstated.
